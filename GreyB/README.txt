The programming language used for the assessment is python3.

For the code to function properly, files 'input.csv' and 'greyb_assessment_code.py' must be in the same directory.

How to run the script?
Open Terminal in the directory that contains the script
Run command: 'python3 greyb_assessment_code.py'

When you press Enter/Return, a JSON file named 'final_output.json' will be created in the same directory. This file contains the desired output.
